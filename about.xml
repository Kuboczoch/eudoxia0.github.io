  I was born in Montevideo in 1994.

  <h1>Colophon</h1>
  This site is a collection of static files, compiled using Make and Common
  Lisp. cl-emb is used for the templates. Wax is used for the markup.

  <h2>"Why not use Github Pages?</h2>
  Because they require -- horror of horrors! -- that I pollute my git repository
  with HTML and CSS. Repositories are for source code and source code only, not
  build output. While Github supports Jekyll, it is too limited for my
  special-snowflake needs, as you can see looking at this site's <link
