  This site is a collection of static files, compiled using Make and Common

  <h2>Why not use Github Pages?</h2>

  Because they require that I pollute my git repository with HTML and
  CSS. Repositories are for source code and source code only, not build
  output. Github does support Jekyll, but this site uses a bunch of custom
  stuff.
