;;;; Discuss Project Valkyrie, lack of specifics and design mistakes,
;;;; improvements. Magnetic monopoles. Monopole-catalyzed fusion. Monopole
;;;; production (Size/luminosity of collider) speculation? Implications to
;;;; speculation re:interstellar travel. Possibly read Krugman's paper on
;;;; insterstellar trade and contrast it.

;;;; * Humans are fragile
;;;; ** Acceleration
;;;; ** Radiation
;;;; ** Life support
;;;; *** Mention CELLS and water wells
;;;; ** Solid state is just up up and away
;;;; * Ship
;;;; ** Considerations
;;;; *** Massively distributed computer cores
;;;; *** Cross-section, shape of computing cores
;;;; *** Radiation shielding
;;;; *** Dust shielding
;;;; *** Propulsion
;;;; **** link to acceleration and radiation re:humans
;;;; **** antimatter, monopoles
;;;; * WBE
;;;; ** some stuff
;;;; * Computers
;;;; ** Neuromorphic chips
;;;; ** Rod logic, other nano stuff
