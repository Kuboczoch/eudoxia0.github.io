  Seen from a rather extraterrestrial perspective, the idea of sending humans --
  canned primates -- across interstellar distances is a completely hubristic
  fantasy. At the very least there's a very sharp contrast, between animals that
  evolved to live a few decades within a couple kilometers of the tribe, and
  incredible machines that can cross the distance between stars.

  Solid state is easier. Hook it up to the tether, and it's <ref id="eleitl">up,
  up and away</ref>.

  <h2>Monopole-Catalyzed Total Conversion</h2>

  <link id="mag">Magnetic monopoles</link> are a particles that act, as their
  name implies, as magnets with a single pole. What makes them interesting, from
  a practical perspective, is that under some <abbr alt="Grand Unified
  Theories">GUTs</abbr>, monopoles trigger <ref id="pdecay">proton decay</ref>
  on contact. The process is essentially the same as pair annihilation, only
  <b>the monopole remains</b>. Which means it can be reused: Throw a stream of
  plasma at a group of magnetically-suspended monopoles, and you have a
  guaranteed fusion reactor.

  I would like to provide here an estimation of the luminosity and diameter of
  an accelerator capable of producing stable magnetic monopoles, but that's too
  far from my grasp. "Circumstellar" seems like a good estimate of size. As for
  the power requirements, I don't think a <link
  id="kardashev">civilization</link> that can produce monopoles has any need for
  them in energy production. However, they remain useful for two obvious
  purposes: Power generation and space propulsion.

  Fission and fusion both require particular ingredients, but protons are all
  the same, and monopoles don't discriminate.

  <h3>Difficulties</h3>

  (Aside from, you know, <i>building a circumstellar supercollider</i>)

  <h4>Stability</h4>

  Monopoles, because of their nature, don't have the safety guarantees of
  nuclear fusion: A monopole-catalyzed fusion reactor may go supercritical, much
  like a fission reactor. Antimatter-catalyzed fusion has this same problem but
  to a much smaller degree: Antimatter is annihilated, monopoles remain.

  <h4>Separating Monopoles from Fusion Products</h4>

  <h3>Monopolar Ramjets</h3>

  This section is somewhat of an afterthought. In 1985, Robert Zubrin and Dana
  Andrews analyzed the Bussard fusion ramjet, and concluded that the drag
  created by protons brushing against the magnetic field is greater than the
  thrust of the engine -- by nine orders of magnitude. So much drag, in fact,
  that it inspired the idea of the <link id="magsail">magnetic sail</link>.

  It is unlikely that a fusion ramjet upgraded to use antimatter or
  monopole-catalyzed fusion will be able to overcome this gap, but the thought
  is left here.

        <quote>Rubakov (1981) and independently Callan (1982a, b) have shown
        that the grand unification monopole, when it passes through matter, can
        induce proton decay through reactions of the type <itex>M + p
        \rightarrow Me^+\pi^0, M\mu^+K^0, Me^+\mu^+\mu^-</itex> etc. The
        monopole would come out unscathed in the reaction, but would cause the
        break up of the proton in a manner identical to what happens in proton
        decay.</quote>
