  <h2>Permutations</h2>

  <p>Given $n$ objects, any <b>linear arrangement</b> of these is a
  permutation. With permutations <b>order matters</b> and <b>repetitions are not
  allowed</b>.

  The number of permutations of size $r$ a set of $n$ objects is $P(n,r) =
  \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$.</p>

  <h3>Permutations with Repetition</h3>

  <p>Given $n$ objects, with $n_1$ objects of type 1, $n_2$ objects of type 2,
  etc. where $n_1 + ... + n_r = n$, the number of permutations with repetitions
  is $PR(n) = \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_r!}$.</p>

  <h2>Combinations</h2>

  <p>Given $n$ objects, the number of subsets (Combinations) of size $r$ is
  $C(n,r) = \frac{P(n,r)}{r!}$. Combinations <b>don't preserve order</b>.</p>

  <h2>Binomial Theorem</h2>

  <p>Given a positive integer $n$: $(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k)x^ky^{n-k}$.</p>

  <h3>Multinomial Theorem</h3>

  <p>The coefficient of $x_1^{n_1}...x_t^{n_t}$ in $(x_1 + ... + x_t)^n$ is
  $\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_t!}$.</p>

  <h2>Combinations with Repetition</h2>

  <p>$CR(n,r) = C(n+r-1, r)$.

  The number of combinations with repetitions of $n$ objects in sets of size $r$
  is the same as:

  <ul>
    <li>The number of integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + ... + x_n = r,
    x_i \gt 0$.</li>
    <li>The number of ways to distribute $r$ identical objects in $n$
    <b>distinct</b> containers.</li>
  </ul>
