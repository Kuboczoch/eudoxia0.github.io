  <h1>Linear System</h1>

  <p>A system of equations looks like this:</p>

  <math>
    \begin{cases}
      2x + 3y + 6z = 3\\
      x â€“ y + 3z = 0\\
      x + -4y + 5z = 1
    \end{cases}
  </math>

  <p>And it can be represented as a matrix, like this (This is the <b>augmented
  matrix</b>. Removing the rightmost column would make it the <b>coefficients
  table</b>):</p>

  <math><![CDATA[
    \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 3 & 6 & 3\\
      1 & -1 & 3 & 0\\
      1 & -4 & 5 & 1\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    ]]>
  </math>

  <p>A linear system is <b>inconsistent</b> if it has no solution, and
  <b>consistent</b> if it has either one solution or infinite solutions.</p>

  <h1>Gaussian Elimination</h1>

  <p>An <b>elementary matrix</b> is the result of applying an elementary row
  operation to the identity matrix.</p>

  <ul>
    <b>Elementary Row Operations</b>
    <li>Interchange: Replacing one row with the other.</li>
    <li>Multiplication: Each element in a row is multiplied by a non-zero $k$.</li>
    <li>Addition: Replacing one row with the sum of itself and a multiplication
    of another.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Gaussian elimination consists of applying these operations to the matrices
  (Formally, applying here means multiplying the matrix by the elementary matrix
  associated to that transformation) to turn the matrix into <b>row echelon
  form</b>, where we can tell whether it's consistent or not, and if it is, find
  its solution set.

  A matrix is in row echelon form when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Every all-zero row is at the bottom of the matrix.</li>
    <li>The leading coefficient of a non-zero row must be to the left of the one below it.</li>
    <li>All entries below a leading coefficient are zero.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The <b>leading coefficient</b> of a matrix is the first non-zero entry in a row).

  Basically, it looks like this:</p>

  <math><![CDATA[
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 7 & 2 & 3\\
      0 & 4 & 1 & 2\\
      0 & 0 & 6 & 9 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    ]]>
  </math>
