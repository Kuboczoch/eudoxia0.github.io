# Project Valkyrie

The Project Valkyrie spacecraft was designed by Charles Pellegrino and James
Powell, and first presented in the book Flying to Valhalla. A more technicaly
description, similar to that in the book's afterword, was presented by
Pellegrino in the essay *"Relativistic robots and the feasibility of
interstellar flight"*[^relrob].

## Design Problems

Possibly the most obvious problem is the violation of the Golden Rule: The ship
has two engines, one at the front and one at the back, because turning broadside
while coasting at relativistic speeds opens the ship up to a disastrous impact.

I doubt the risk would be significant, but even if it were -- Even if
interstellar space does turn out to be a constant shower of ice crystals --
there's simply no way to justify doubling the mass of an engine that is already
bound to be massive.

The solution is fairly obvious: Engine, tether, crew and cargo, in that order
from zenith to nadir. The process of turning the engine safely would be:

1. While coasting, and when the engine is off, roll up the tether until the
   cargo is next to the engine.
2. Eject the shielding and its power source, and vernier it a few hundreds of
   meters forward.
3. Rotate the engine/cargo. Most of it would remain within the shadow of the
   shield, but some areas would probably be exposed to impacts (Although this
   depends on the specifics of the shielding).
4. Attach the shielding to the cargo section.
5. Extend the tether.
6. Relight the engine at will.

Note that while the ship was accelerating, the forces were those of the engine
and those of drag from the shielding. As the ship decelerates, drag from the
shielding will push the cargo section closer to the engine. The engine, then,
has to run perpetually and counteract this drag so the tether remains taut.

## Are humans worth it?

Seen from a rather extraterrestrial perspective, the idea of sending humans --
canned primates -- across interstellar distances is a completely hubristic
fantasy. At the very least there's a very sharp contrast, between animals that
evolved to live a few decades within a couple kilometers of the tribe, and
incredible machines that can cross the distance between stars.

Solid state is easier. Hook it up to the tether, and it's up, up and
away[^eleitl].

# Propulsion

## Antimatter

## Monopole-Catalyzed Total Conversion

[Magnetic monopoles][mag] are particles that act, as their name implies, as
magnets with a single pole. What makes them interesting, from a practical
perspective, is that under some GUTs, monopoles trigger proton decay[^pdecay] on
contact. The process is essentially the same as pair annihilation, only **the
monopole remains**. Which means it can be reused: Throw a stream of plasma at a
group of magnetically-suspended monopoles, and you have a guaranteed fusion
reactor.

I would like to provide here an estimation of the luminosity and diameter of an
accelerator capable of producing stable magnetic monopoles, but that's too far
from my grasp. "Circumstellar" seems like a good estimate of size.  As for the
power requirements, I don't think a [civilization][kardashev] that can produce
monopoles has any need for them in energy production. However, they remain
useful for two obvious purposes: Power generation and space propulsion.

Fission and fusion both require particular ingredients, but protons are all the
same, and monopoles don't discriminate.

As an aside: We don't know the exact mass of magnetic monopoles. Estimates vary
from $600~\mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{16}~\mathrm{GeV}$, the latter being *"comparable
to the mass of a bacterium, or the kinetic energy of a charging
rhinoceros"*[^monmass].

### Difficulties

#### Stability

Monopoles, because of their nature, don't have the safety guarantees of nuclear
fusion: A monopole-catalyzed fusion reactor may go supercritical, much like a
fission reactor. Antimatter-catalyzed fusion has this same problem but to a much
smaller degree: Antimatter is annihilated, monopoles remain.

#### Separating Monopoles from Fusion Products

### Monopolar Ramjets

This section is somewhat of an afterthought. In 1985, Robert Zubrin and Dana
Andrews analyzed the Bussard fusion ramjet, and concluded that the drag created
by protons brushing against the magnetic field is greater than the thrust of the
engine -- by nine orders of magnitude. So much drag, in fact, that it inspired
the idea of the [magnetic sail][magsail].

It is unlikely that a fusion ramjet upgraded to use antimatter or
monopole-catalyzed fusion will be able to overcome this gap, but the thought is
left here.

    >Rubakov (1981) and independently Callan (1982a, b) have shown that the
    grand unification monopole, when it passes through matter, can induce proton
    decay through reactions of the type $M + p \rightarrow Me^+\pi^0, M\mu^+K^0,
    Me^+\mu^+\mu^-$ etc. The monopole would come out unscathed in the reaction,
    but would cause the break up of the proton in a manner identical to what
    happens in proton decay.
