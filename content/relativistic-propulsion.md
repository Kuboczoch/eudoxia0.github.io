      >Rubakov (1981) and independently Callan (1982a, b) have shown that the
      grand unification monopole, when it passes through matter, can induce
      proton decay through reactions of the type $M + p \rightarrow Me^+\pi^0$,
      $M\mu^+K^0$, $Me^+\mu^+\mu^-$ etc. The monopole would come out unscathed
      in the reaction, but would cause the break up of the proton in a manner
      identical to what happens in proton decay.

      The author remarks that "[Monopoles] could never be produced in any
      man-made accelerator, existing or conceivable".

      Here, "conceivable" could be interpreted as "reasonable for a sane
      non-transhumanist" (ie a particle accelerator smaller than a continent) or
      "physically possible" (A particle accelerator the size of the galaxy
      doesn't count).

# Project Valkyrie

The Project Valkyrie spacecraft was designed by Charles Pellegrino and James
Powell, and first presented in the book Flying to Valhalla. A more technicaly
description, similar to that in the book's afterword, was presented by
Pellegrino in the essay *Relativistic robots and the feasibility of interstellar
flight*[^relrob].

In it, Pellegrino makes this claim:

>The Valkyrie, as our rocket is called, will have a maximum cruising speed of 92
percent lightspeed

I have yet to see a detailed explanation of how this number was reached. The
design of the Valkyrie, at least in the abstract, is certainly very promising,
but I wouldn't make any specific numerical claims.

I've bought *Flying to Valhalla*. It's one of the few books I've actually
bought, and while I wouldn't say it's very good in its specifics, the general
ideas make it a worthwhile read.

## Design Problems

Possibly the most obvious problem is the violation of the Golden Rule: The ship
has two engines, one at the front and one at the back, because turning broadside
while coasting at relativistic speeds opens the ship up to a disastrous impact.

I doubt the risk would be significant, but even if it were -- Even if
interstellar space does turn out to be a constant shower of ice crystals --
there's simply no way to justify doubling the mass of an engine that is already
bound to be massive.

The solution is fairly obvious: Engine, tether, crew and cargo, in that order
from zenith to nadir. The process of turning the engine safely would be:

- While coasting, and when the engine is off, roll up the tether until the cargo
  is next to the engine.
- Eject the shielding and its power source, and vernier it a few hundreds of
  meters forward.
- Rotate the engine/cargo. Most of it would remain within the shadow of the
  shield, but some areas would probably be exposed to impacts (Although this
  depends on the specifics of the shielding).
- Attach the shielding to the cargo section.
- Extend the tether.
- Relight the engine at will.

Note that while the ship was accelerating, the forces were those of the engine
and those of drag from the shielding. As the ship decelerates, drag from the
shielding will push the cargo section closer to the engine. The engine, then,
has to run perpetually and counteract this drag so the tether remains taut.

# Humans are Fragile

## Acceleration

## Radiation

## Life Support

## Are humans worth it?

Seen from a rather extraterrestrial perspective, the idea of sending humans --
canned primates -- across interstellar distances is a completely hubristic
fantasy. At the very least there's a very sharp contrast, between animals that
evolved to live a few decades within a couple kilometers of the tribe, and
incredible machines that can cross the distance between stars.

Solid state is easier. Hook it up to the tether, and it's up, up and
away[^eleitl].

# Propulsion

## Antimatter

## Monopole-Catalyzed Total Conversion

[Magnetic monopoles][mag] are particles that act, as their name implies, as
magnets with a single pole. What makes them interesting, from a practical
perspective, is that under some GUTs, monopoles trigger proton decay[^pdecay] on
contact. The process is essentially the same as pair annihilation, only **the
monopole remains**. Which means it can be reused: Throw a stream of plasma at a
group of magnetically-suspended monopoles, and you have a guaranteed fusion
reactor.

Magnetic monopoles are guaranteed to exist. Every school of modern physics
agrees that they exist. They explain the quantization of electric charge and
certain subtleties about the post-inflation early Universe I'm too simple to
understand.

I would like to provide here an estimation of the luminosity and diameter of an
accelerator capable of producing stable magnetic monopoles, but that's too far
from my grasp. "Circumstellar" seems like a good estimate of size.  As for the
power requirements, I don't think a [civilization][kardashev] that can produce
monopoles has any need for them in energy production. However, they remain
useful for two obvious purposes: Power generation in deep-space operations, and
space propulsion.

Fission and fusion both require particular ingredients, but protons are all the
same, and monopoles don't discriminate.

As an aside: We don't know the exact mass of magnetic monopoles. Estimates vary
from $4 \times 10^4~\mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{17}~\mathrm{GeV}$[^lindell], the
latter being *"comparable to the mass of a bacterium, or the kinetic energy of a
charging rhinoceros"*[^preskill].

### Difficulties

<sidenote>
  (Aside from, you know, *building a circumstellar supercollider*)
</sidenote>

#### Producing Magnetic Monopoles

"Build a very big accelerator" is incredibly vague. What exactly would it have
to *do* to produce magnetic monopoles? Lindell references a paper[^production]
that proposes using high energy $pp$ (That's proton-proton) collisions to
produce a monopole-antimonopole pair through photon fusion, but the paper is
behind a paywall so I can't comment on that.

Instead I tried to get two papers that cite it, *Monopolium production from
photon fusion at the Large Hadron Collider*[^monopolium] and *Looking for
magnetic monopoles at LHC with diphoton events*[^lhc].

#### Stability

Monopoles, because of their nature, don't have the safety guarantees of nuclear
fusion: A monopole-catalyzed fusion reactor may go supercritical, much like a
fission reactor. Antimatter-catalyzed fusion has this same problem but to a much
smaller degree: Antimatter is annihilated, monopoles remain.

#### Separating Monopoles from Fusion Products

We want the plasma and gamma rays from fusion to leave the exhaust, but the
monopoles to remain, which is bound to be hard since the monopoles will be
pushed around by the highly-energetic fusion reactions that themselves trigger.

A possible solution takes advantage of the vast mass difference between a proton
and a Grand Unification monopole: If you make both travel in an arc, guided by a
magnetic field, the monopole will stick to its original trajectory more than the
proton, because it has a much greater inertia. The specifics of this would
probably be fairly complicated, and require actually knowing the mass of
monopoles.

#### Monopolar Ramjets

This section is somewhat of an afterthought. In 1985, Robert Zubrin and Dana
Andrews analyzed the Bussard fusion ramjet, and concluded that the drag created
by protons brushing against the magnetic field is greater than the thrust of the
engine -- by nine orders of magnitude. So much drag, in fact, that it inspired
the idea of the [magnetic sail][magsail].

It is unlikely that a fusion ramjet upgraded to use antimatter or
monopole-catalyzed fusion will be able to overcome this gap, but the thought is
left here.

# Design

## Shielding

## Dust

## Radiation

## Tether

The tether is an important part of the spacecraft and is in a very vulnerable
position: Sandwiched between the exhaust plumes of two engines with massive
power outputs. Radiation from the conversion reactions and plasma from the plume
could erode the tether over time, and heat radiatied by the plume and absorbed
by the tether could cause it to overheat and maybe require its own cooling
system.

To address this last problem, the tether should be a ribbon: Wide, flat, and
coplanar with both engines. A ribbon exposes a smaller cross-section to the
exhaust plumes and would absorb less heat, as you can see in the very scientific
image below:

Specifically, a tether with radius $r$ exposes $r\pi$ of surface to each engine,
while a tether with the same cross-sectional area as the ribbon ($r^2\pi$) and
with a width of $10r\pi$ would only expose $r/10$ (wow, such math). Not having
the tether overheat removes one requirement: A vast, multi-kilometer long
cooling system that just adds mass.
