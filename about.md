## Colophon

This site is built with [Jekyll][jekyll], which needs no introduction, and
[Sass][sass], a CSS preprocessor. Hosting is provided by [GitHub
Pages][pages].

The map on the front page is generated dynamically with [Leaflet][leaflet],
and the style was from a Leaflet providers [demo][demo]. The map shows a
section of Montevideo, (coincidentally) almost centered on [TryoLabs][tryo].
