# About Me

I was born in the 28th of November of 1994. The same day, in 1894, Henry Hazlitt
was born; in 1520, Magellan became the first European to cross into the Pacific
from the Atlantic; and in 1954, Enrico Fermi died.

I usually go by **eudoxia** on the Internet.

I can often be found in the [`##hplusroadmap`][hplus] channel on Freenode
([Webchat][hplus-web]) as **eudoxia**.
